"Hell is breaking through in the Caverns. If that portal isn't closed before those ships arrive, Earth will be destroyed. Earth... That's what they've always wanted... they were there, once; lost it in the dawn of time. Now it's so close, they can taste it..."

--------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW:


* Game Type - Half-Life Deathmatch
* Map Size - Small
* Recommended Max Players - 6
* Available Weapons - Shotgun x1, MP5 x2, Crossbow x1, Gluon Gun x1, Tripmines x2, M203 Grenades x2

--------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT NOTES:


Note to Software Mode Users: This map makes extensive use of transparency and oriented sprites. As a result, it will be completely unplayable in software mode even on powerful CPUs. OpenGL or Xash3D are required. OpenGL GoldSrc is recommended.

Note to Xash3D Engine Users: Xash3D has various inaccuracies compared to the original GoldSrc engine. Some effects will look incorrect, such as the fog effect and light beam effects. For best results, use GoldSrc (Steam or WON) Half-Life.

DESCRIPTION:


For a long time now (most of my mapping career, in fact) I've had an unhealthy obsession with the aesthetics and architecture of the 'Caverns 1' level from Doom 3. The combination of gloomy subterranean caverns, heavy industry, and prefabricated infrastructure just hits all the right notes for me. If you're familiar with my work, you've no doubt seen the influence in some of my maps; "Cavernous" is probably the most recent and prominent example, but it was there even as far back as "BMRF Sublevels". This is the first time, however, I've actually made a map explicitly themed after the Caverns.

This is also the first time in a long time that I've completely cut loose. Again, if you're familiar with my work, you'll know that most of my recent maps are heavily constrained to work on older hardware, mostly by staying below 1200 WPoly. This time, however, I decided to sww what would happen if I *didn't* limit myself. The result is still below 3000 WPoly, but uses a lot of complex effects, so if you're playing on a toaster, you probably can't run this map.

In any case, this is my love letter to Caverns 1.
