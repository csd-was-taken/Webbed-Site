Nuketown - Fight Yard
by Tommy (http://www.youtube.com/user/T0mmyPL)
vehicles prefabs by Corvalho and Milburn

Background: Nuclear testing grounds.
Lots of fast paced action. The map is based on a typical U.S. suburb used to demonstrate the effects of a nuclear
weapon on a residential area.
Nuketown is a small map.

Other Notes: Have Fun :)
