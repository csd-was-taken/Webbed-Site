Description
--------------------------------
A medium-sized arena with a techno-alien theme.  The map is designed for fast-paced action, and it works well as a duel map.  Players start out with a full weapons loadout and a long-jump module, which means less time searching, and more time fighting. =)  

(Hexery is a remake of Nefarious, a map that W1s3.wad made but never got around to releasing.)
