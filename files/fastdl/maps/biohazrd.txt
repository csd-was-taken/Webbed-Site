Deathmatch              : Nope... just kidding - of couse its DM!
Number of Players       : 18 Starts, lots of powerups.  Should do 8 fine, 16 if

                          players. 4 should be really nice.
Gamma Correction        : You may want a slightly higher gamma than usual... unless
                          you, like me, like darkish, moody levels.

who don't.  A big round of applause for Valve.

* Other Info *

This level is a deathmatch level.  Nuff said!

* About the Author

My name is Suren Pillay. I live in South Africa. I am 18.  
I like brunettes (WOMEN ONLY). I beat the ZeusBot (Second only to 
the ReaperBot), and Quake on Nightmare skill.  I am a DGAK (DOOM
grand ass kicker: unofficially though). I have clocked Duke3D and 
MDK, Quake2 and Half-Life on hard skill and I have so many DM frags 
that I... I... Umm what does a guy do with frags anyway? My only 
ambition is to be a game programmer/artist/designer! And that was 
the story of my life!

As I said before, I have created many levels before:-
Cold Storage: Technological DM level, DoomTex.WAD (TRA_CSTR.ZIP) 
Death in the Mix:  Gothic DM level, Fire&Ice.WAD  (TRA_DMIX.ZIP)  
The Citadel of Savagery:  Medieval DM level, Medieval.wad (TRA_CSAV.ZIP)
The Domain of Darkness:  Runic DM level, Metal.Wad (TRA_DOD.ZIP)
HellStar:  Technological DM level, StarDust.Wad (TRA_HSTR.ZIP)
Architecturally, they beat the hell out of the one room cock-ups that most
people try to pass off as DM levels.  They offer a scintilating orgy
of bloodlust, sadistic violence and pandemonic mayhem, and they play well 
too!

I prefer techno stuff - I have done LOTS of DOOM levels, but I haven't 
released any.  I can't wait for Quake III, and then you will see my true
talents, I hope! (If I get a decent system)

If you want to release any utilities, levels, misson packs for Quake III 
or any other game give me a call... I ain't got anything better to do!
If you have a level editor for Quake III, I would be happy to help with 
coding, testing, ideas, etc. 

At the moment, I'm working on a crappy 200MMX which is too slow, has too 
little memory, too little hard drive space and too small a monitor.  If the
level is crap, blame the system... It crashed 27 times during design.

* Hints * !!!SPOILER WARNING!!! !!!SPOILER WARNING!!! !!!SPOILER WARNING!!!

The following is a strategy guide... it is only intended for inexperinced 
players who will be shredded in this level!  

The weapon locations are:
* Crowbar... none
* 9mm Pistol... none
* 357 Magnum... the room next to the gauss room, near the longjump module,
  overlooking the small slime pit.
* 9MM Assult Rifle... all over the place, especially the central room.
* Shotgun... all over the place, especially the storage room.
* Crossbow... Sniper deck, overlooking the central room, opposite the 
  small slime pit.
* Gauss Rifle... gauss room, overlooking the small slime pit - use the 
  longjump to get it
* Egon... egon room, jump through the rotors to get it.
* Rocket Launcher... container room jump on top of the containers - you 
  need the longjump
* Hornet Gun... in all the toxic slime.
* Satchels, Snarks, Tripmines, Hand Grenades, AR Grenades... scattered 
  around the stairwells.

The point of this level was an experiment: readily availabe small arms and 
ammo, scarce big weapons and ammo.  Should be interesting to say the least. 
Health is readily available... I was trying to create a Quake DM6 style.

* FAQ * 

Some dumb questions I have been asked by "friends":

* Why is the rocket so hard to get?  You aren't supposed to get it!  Duh!
* Why is the gauss so hard to get?  You aren't supposed to get it!  Duh!
* Why is the egon so hard to get?  Do you see a pattern developing?
* Why is the level designed this way and not that way?  If you like a 
  level a certain way, make your own!
* Why can't I afford a decent system? Because one dollar makes 750 000 Rands 
  (S.A. Currency) and chips are pretty expensive down here!
